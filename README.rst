Fibernavigator
==============

The Fibernavigator is a tool designed for a fast and versatile visualization of fibers datasets.

**NEW!** New **video tutorials** of the Fibernavigator are available.

- `Scene navigation`_: how to interact with the 3D view, move planes, etc.
- `Mesh display and interaction`_: how to create and modify the display of meshes.
- `Drawing tool`_: how to draw on empty or already existing anatomies.
- `Fiber navigation`_: how to interact with fibers and select a subset of them.

A list of all tutorials can be seen on the `video tutorials`_ page.

Highlights:
-----------

- Fast and efficient visualization of the results of deterministic and probabilistic tractograms.
- Interactive selection of fibers.
- Real-time fiber tractography.
- Display of MRI, functional MRI and EEG/MEG source localization results.

How to get the application
--------------------------

- `Build instructions for Ubuntu`_ and other Linux distros are provided
- Windows and OSX builds are available on the Releases_ page.
